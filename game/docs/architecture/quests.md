# Quests

Quests are scripts written in [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md), run by inkjs. They serve town talk and full text quests. Radio calls keep their own engine in `src/sim/dialogue.ts`.

## Content

- Each quest is one `.ink` file in `src/data/quests/`, named by its quest id. Every quest includes `world.ink`.
- `world.ink` declares the shared world variables and every `EXTERNAL` game function. A variable a quest declares itself belongs to that quest, and two quests may use the same name.
- Saved variables are int, float, bool or string. A `LIST` or a divert held in a variable fails the build, since a save cannot hold it.
- `npm run quests:build` compiles every quest into `src/data/quests.json`, which the game reads. A test fails when the bundle is stale. The bundle holds each quest's story, its variables with their types and initial values, and its checkpoints.

## Checkpoints

- A checkpoint is a knot or stitch whose first tag is `# checkpoint: <knot>` or `# checkpoint: <knot.stitch>`. The tag must name its own section, or the build fails.
- A quest starts at one of its checkpoints. While it runs, the session remembers the last checkpoint whose line played.
- A save keeps the last checkpoint, not ink's position. Load starts the quest again there, so the player sees the lines from that checkpoint on.
- Load restarts ink's own counts. A used-up `*` choice comes back, and `{knot}` visit counts start from zero. A fact that must last past a load or into another quest lives in a variable.
- Every checkpoint must run on its own from a fresh story, so it may not rely on temporary variables or tunnels from before it.
- A load plays a checkpoint's opening again, up to its first choices. So that opening may call no effect and change no variable, or each load would pay or count again. Put them after a choice. `restoreQuest()` throws on either, and `npm run quests:check` tries a load at every state it walks.

## State

`player.quests` in `src/sim/types.ts` holds the quest state.

- `world` and `local[quest]` hold variables whose value differs from their declaration. A new variable, or a new initial value, reaches old saves the way it reaches a new game.
- `session` is the open quest: its id, last checkpoint and the seed of ink's random numbers. One quest is open at a time.
- `live` holds ink's own state and the lines and choices on view. Saves skip it, and load rebuilds it from the session with `restoreQuest()`.

`src/sim/quests.ts` owns the runner. `startQuest()` and `chooseQuestOption()` are commands through `update()`, so a failed pick leaves the world unchanged. `questView()` gives the lines with their tags, the choices and whether the quest ended. A quest at its end closes its session and keeps its last lines on view.

## Game functions

- Each `EXTERNAL` in `world.ink` has one function in `src/sim/quests.ts`: a query in `QUEST_QUERIES` or an effect in `QUEST_EFFECTS`.
- A query only reads the world. An effect changes the world of the running command, and ink never runs it ahead of a pick.
- Money crosses in whole M: `money()` reads it and `give_money(amount)` pays it.
- Game state such as money is read through a query, never copied into an ink variable.

## Saves

- A save holds `player.quests` without `live`, so it holds no ink state.
- Load raises a `SaveError` on a stored quest, variable, type or checkpoint the current bundle does not declare.
- The rescue screen then carries every variable the bundle still declares with the same type, lists the rest as lost, and closes the open quest. `fittingQuestVars()` decides.
- `src/three/save-shape.json` records every saved variable name with its type and every checkpoint. Removing, renaming or retyping one needs a migration step, and `npm run save:shape` refuses it under the recorded format. Additions need no step.
- `src/three/save-migrations.ts` has pure helpers for those steps: `renameQuestVar()`, `dropQuestVar()`, `moveQuestCheckpoint()`, `endQuestSession()` and `dropQuest()`. A null quest means a world variable.

## Tools

- `npm run quest -- <quest>` plays a quest in the terminal on a new game, compiled fresh from the sources, so an edit plays without a build. Choices are numbered from 1. `--checkpoint <name>` starts at another checkpoint than the first. `--picks 1,2` plays those choices, and without it the player types picks. `--set name=value` sets a world or quest variable before the start. `--save <file>` writes the quest state as a save holds it. `--load <file>` checks that state against the sources. With an open session of the quest it resumes at its checkpoint, and with no open session it starts the quest with the saved variables, so one quest's outcome carries into the next.
- `npm run quests:check` fails on compile errors and warnings, broken checkpoint tags, saved types it cannot hold, game functions missing on either side and a stale bundle. It then walks every choice from every checkpoint through the runner and fails on ink errors, on states from which no choice leads to an end, and on sections never reached. It names the picks that lead to each problem. A Vitest test runs the same check.
- The walk merges states by ink's position, variables, visit counts up to 3 and money. It stops at 5,000 states and fails, since an unchecked quest must not pass. Game queries answer as on a new game, so a branch on a game query is walked on one side only.
